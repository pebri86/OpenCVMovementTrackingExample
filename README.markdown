Description
-----------

This is a code example that extracts movement out of a running webcam capture. I created this example in Qt Creator with the MSVC2010 compiler under OpenCV v2.3.1.

I used the new C++ syntax instead of the old and messy C syntax.


Compiling
---------

If you're a Qt Creator user, just load the .pro file and compile it. Alternatively you can use qmake on the command line. You will need to download the [OpenCV v2.3.1 Superpack](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.3.1/OpenCV-2.3.1-win-superpack.exe/download) to make it work.


Running
-------

I've also made a prebuilt Windows binary in the *bin/* directory. Unless you don't have the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 runtime installed you should be able to run it without downloading any additional libraries.


Legal stuff
-----------

Use my code however you like in accordance with local laws. Void where prohibited. Keep in mind that OpenCV comes under a different license!
